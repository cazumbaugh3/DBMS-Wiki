# Aggregation
Aggregation functions perform a calculation on several values and return a single result. With the exception of the [Count] function, aggregate functions ignore `NULL` values. Aggregate functions are often combined with [[GROUP BY|GROUP BY]] and [[HAVING|HAVING]] clauses.

SQL provides various aggregate functions:
* [COUNT()](Count.md)
* [SUM()](Sum.md)
* [AVG()](Avg.md)
* [MIN()](Min.md)
* [MAX()](Max.md)
